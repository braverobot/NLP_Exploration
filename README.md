# NLP Exploration Project

## Overview
This project is dedicated to exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) using advanced libraries and frameworks such as Hugging Face, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. The focus is on leveraging transformer models to address various NLP tasks.

---

## Objectives
The primary goal of this exploration is to understand and implement NLP techniques using transformers. Each component aims to provide practical insights into the capabilities and applications of NLP in real-world scenarios.

## Documentation Structure

### Notebook 1: Introduction to NLP Concepts
The first notebook serves as an introduction to the fundamental concepts of NLP, setting the stage for more complex applications.This includes:

- Sentiment Analysis
- Text Classification
- Text Summarization
- Text Generation
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Question Answering
- Language Translation

### Notebook N: Subsequent Notebooks
Further notebooks delve into specific NLP tasks, demonstrating practical implementation and analysis. I'll add them here later.

## Supplementary Materials
As part of this exploration, we examine the 'Gadgetron', a concept product, to demonstrate the application of NLP in product feedback analysis.
